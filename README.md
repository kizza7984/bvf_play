Images are from the SDK emulator but it works the same on the real device.

## Installation

Download the Add-In file `BVFPLAY.G1A` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kizza7984/bvf_play/releases) and install it. The easiest way to install it is to connect the calculator as a storage device via USB cable, then place the file in the root directory of the storage memory.

## Usage

1. Place a BVF file named `output.bvf` in the root directory of the calculator's storage memory.
2. Run the Add-In.
